# Market Costs Regression Challenge

Welcome to the "Market Costs Regression" competition, where your expertise in advanced regression modeling will be put to the test. In this challenge, your mission is to create sophisticated models capable of making accurate cost predictions in a dynamic market environment. By analyzing a rich dataset encompassing a wide range of variables from market trends to consumer characteristics, you will uncover underlying patterns to forecast product costs with precision.

## Project Overview

The competition revolves around the concept of using regression analysis to predict market costs. You will have access to an extensive dataset, offering insights into various aspects of the market and consumer behavior. The challenge is not just to fit a model but to interpret and utilize the data effectively, discovering hidden relationships that impact costs.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provided is comprehensive and includes several dimensions that contribute to market dynamics:

- **Person Description**: Information about the demographics and characteristics of individuals visiting the market.
- **Place Code**: Unique identifier for each market location, composed of two city codes.
- **Customer Order**: Detailed records of customer purchases in the market.
- **Additional Features in Market**: Enumerates various amenities and services available in the market, like a coffee bar, florist, etc.
- **Promotion Name**: Advertising campaigns or promotions conducted by the market.
- **Store Kind**: Categorization of the store based on its genre or theme.
- **Store Cost**: The financial outlay required to establish and maintain the store.
- **Store Sales**: Total revenue generated by the store since its inception.
- **Gross Weight**: Total weight of purchased items, including packaging.
- **Net Weight**: Weight of the purchased items excluding packaging.
- **Package Weight**: Weight of the packaging material alone.
- **Is Recyclable?**: Indicates whether the item or its packaging is recyclable.
- **Yearly Income**: Estimated annual income of the consumer.
- **Store Area**: Total floor area of the store.
- **Grocery Area**: Space allocated to the grocery department within the store.
- **Frozen Area**: Space dedicated to frozen food items.
- **Meat Area**: Area of the store reserved for meat products.
- **Cost**: The target variable that your model will predict.

## Challenge Goals

- **Model Development**: Utilize regression techniques to build models that can accurately predict costs based on the dataset.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand how different features influence market costs.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and leverage hidden patterns and correlations within the data for more accurate predictions.

# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Guide


## 1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves preparing raw data for further analysis and modeling. It includes cleaning and transforming data to improve its quality and usefulness.

### 1.1 Rename Features
- **Objective**: Improve readability and consistency in the dataset by renaming feature columns.
- **Rationale**: Clear and descriptive column names make the dataset easier to understand and work with.
- **Methodology**: Use the `rename` function in Pandas to modify column names.
